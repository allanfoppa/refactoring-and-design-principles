# Folder Summary: `Bloaters`

## Overview

Bloaters are code smells that occur when a codebase grows excessively in size, making it harder to maintain and understand. They often indicate poor design or lack of refactoring.

## Topics

### `Long Method`
    - This file contains methods that are excessively long, making them hard to read and maintain.
    - Extract smaller methods.
    - Use meaningful method names to improve readability.

### `Large Class`
    - The class has too many fields and methods, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
    - Split the class into smaller, more focused classes.
    - Delegate responsibilities to helper classes.

### `Primitive Obsession`
    - Overuse of primitive types instead of creating domain-specific objects.
    - Replace primitives with value objects.
    - Use enums or constants for better readability.

### `Long Parameter List`
    - Methods have too many parameters, making them hard to use and understand.
    - Introduce parameter objects.
    - Use builder patterns for complex object creation.

### `Data Clumps`
    - Groups of variables that are often used together but not encapsulated in a class.
    - Encapsulate the data into a class or structure.
    - Pass the new object instead of individual variables.

## Notes

- Regularly review and refactor code to prevent bloat.
- Follow SOLID principles to maintain clean and modular code.
- Use automated tools to detect and address code smells.
