# Folder Summary: `Object Orientation Abusers`

## Overview

This folder contains notes and examples related to the "Object Orientation Abusers" category of code smells in software development. These smells arise when object-oriented principles are misused or violated, leading to poor design and maintainability issues.

## Topics

### `Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces`
    - Two classes perform similar functions but have different interfaces.
    - Refactor by unifying the interfaces or consolidating the classes.

### `Refused Bequest`
    - A subclass uses only a portion of its inherited functionality.
    - Consider composition over inheritance or redesign the class hierarchy.

### `Temporary Field`
    - A field is set only under certain conditions and remains empty otherwise.
    - Refactor by moving the field to a class where it is always relevant or encapsulate it in a dedicated object.

### `Incomplete Library Class`
    - A library class does not provide all the functionality needed.
    - Extend the library class or create a wrapper to add the missing functionality.

## Notes

- Focus on adhering to object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Encourages thoughtful design and refactoring to improve code clarity and maintainability.

This folder serves as a guide for identifying and addressing object-oriented design issues to enhance software quality.
